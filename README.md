# sillyStuff

A repo for silly gifs and images.

Some of the scripts in the scripts folder are apple action scripts. Their purpose is to be used when triggered by a calendar event through the Mac OS X Automator app.
The scripts should be able to be ran as a UNIX style shell script.
Was having some trouble getting random numbers to pipe through to the curl command so we got a different image from this repo each time the script was ran.
